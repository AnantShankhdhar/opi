	<h3>5. Fifteen Years Back my neighbor Mrs. Sareen had three daughters Sudha, Seema and Reema -- and their combined ages were half of hers. During the next five years Sonny was born and Mrs. Sareen's age equaled the total of her children’s ages. </h3>
	<h3>After Some years Kishu was born and then Sudha was as old as Reema and Sonny together. And now, the combined age of all the children is double Mrs. Sareen’s age, which is, as matter of fact, only equal to that of Sudha and Seema together. Sudha’s age is also equal to that of two sons. </h3>
	<h3>What is the sum of ages of all of them?</h3>
